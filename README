README

mkplanet generates images of imaginary worlds. It uses Torben Mogensen's
"planet" tool, which generates 2D maps using a fractal algorithm, and
Xplanet, which renders the map onto a 3D sphere. mkplanet also adds
other effects to improve the realism of the final image, including
cratering, clouds, and an atmospheric haze.
                
REQUIREMENTS

mkplanet requires that planet and Xplanet be installed on the system. 
Xplanet is widely available via most distribution's package system (ie 
yum or apt), but you may need to compile and install planet yourself. 
The author of mkplanet has created packages for RPM based Linux 
distributions, which can be found at http://jodrell.org/files.
    
You will also need either ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick as mkplanet has
to convert and composite images as part of the process.
